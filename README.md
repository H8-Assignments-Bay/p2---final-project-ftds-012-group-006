# AutoRate

[![AutoRate](https://github.com/H8-Assignments-Bay/p2---final-project-ftds-012-group-006/blob/main/img/Auto_Rate_Comment.png "AutoRate")]
###AutoRate

The technology has brought us to the era of e-commerce. More traditional seller are turning to online commerce by registering their store to the marketplace.
One indicator of a successful online business credibility is a high user rating. By having a high user rating, it can be interpreted that the online business has succeeded in customer trust. Giving an inappropriate rating can affect the credibility of an online store.
This project aims to offer a solution to minimize the occurrence of rating errors by creating a model that can predict the marketplace rating based on customer comment

-------------
This application is very easy, customers only need to type their comments and the results will come out automatically.
This really helps the customer to determine teh score and helps the sellers to gain trust from customers. Maybe there are customers whose technology illiterate is also very helpful with the application.
